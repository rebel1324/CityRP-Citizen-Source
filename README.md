## What is this?
This is collection of head and clothes for customizing in Garry's Mod Gamemode Nutscript's schema, CityRP. with this models, you can actually customize your character without getting hundreds of different models in your workshop folder and you can actually add more contents to your server.

## Original Source
This Citizen Model is came from Zelpa's Enhanced Citizen Models.: https://github.com/zelpa/enhancedcitizens

## Where can I get released version?
Because of my shitty QC/Modeling skill You'll see so many eye bleeding stuffs, But still, you can try to make it more custom and make it look more good.

## How do i compile? 
Use [Crowbar Tool](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/CrowbarTool) to compile the model for the Garry's Mod or other Source Engines. 

## Can I use it?
Well- yes. as long as Zelpa comes to me and stop using my models and stuffs. but it's been around long time so you should not worry about it.
